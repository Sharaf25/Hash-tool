# Hash-tool
Hashing tool that helps you to hash a plain text with 6 algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA384, SHA224, SHA256, SHA512). Also you can compare a plain text with cipher text and if it's similar it tells you the hashed algorithm that has been used to hash the plain text

This tool is useful if you got a hash from (MAN IN THE MIDDLE) attack and you want to check plain text with this hash.
It also helps you if you don't know what algorithm that has been used to hash this text
